Welcome to my Wordle!

Wordle is a game where you have five attempts to guess a hidden five letter word. Each time you guess a word the game will tell you if you have guessed any letters that are in the word (which are highlighted orange),
or if you have guessed any letters which are in the word AND in the correct placement within the world (these are highlighted green). If you have guessed the hidden word correctly within five attempts you win!

It plays a lot easier than it reads :)

I chose to build Wordle because I felt it put a lot of skills I had recently acquired to the test - specifically using multidimensional arrays, different loops, event listeners and query selectors in order to
provide functions and solution that would solve some of the more complex logic problems behind the game, such as recognising and coloring individual letters within user guesses after comparing them to the hidden
word (shout out to the split() method and my homies at MDN Web Docs for that one).

The game also afforded me the chance to move away from Flexbox and use CSS Grid for the first time as well as building a HTML keyboard within the browser for my gamers to use. Both of these were fun and provided
my Wordle with a fairly clean and structured look.

The technologies used were JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Enjoy the game!
